# udemy-scss

Code written here is following the Udemy Advanced CSS and Sass course found here: https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/v4/overview.

The course has been very helpful in teaching CSS and Sass and I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about either of the topics.
